    <h1>Trans-Fem*</h1>
  <p>Trans-Fem* is a peer support group for anyone looking to cultivate a more femme

     or presentation to attend this group.</p>

 <h2 class="blue">Group Intentions and Etiquette</h2>
 <p>Our one broad group agreement is to be kind. Some examples of what being kind might
    look like in a peer support group space include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Pausing between people speaking</b> This helps people process and makes
          certain one person is done talking before another person begins. Don't be
          afraid of silence.</li>
      <li><b>Practicing active listening and being present</b> When someone is done sharing feel 
          free to take time to reflect internally on what was said, why that person might have shared it,
          and what you're understanding of it might be missing.</li>
      <li><b>Taking care of your needs</b> Make accommodations and advocate for yourself if a
          discussion is upsetting to you. (i.e. take a break from the group space for 20 minutes to do some
          grounding and check in with yourself)</li>
    </ul>
  <p>By thinking about and implementing these ideas as you navigate your time at
     Trans-Fem* you can help yourself get support and help others get effective support
     as well.</p>
  <h3>Zoom (online group) Tips</h3>
  <p>Please mute yourself unless talking (you can use spacebar/alt+a on a computer to unmute) to avoid background noise.
     A group facilitator might mute you if they hear background noise, feel free to unmute when you are ready to talk.
     Using the Gallery view allows you to see everyone at once.
